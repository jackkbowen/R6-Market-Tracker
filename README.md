## To-do list
- making up/down arrows have a limit of 1 visible at a time. ~~need to make all buttons uniform size to keep  layout from moving around? ~~
- ~~ work more with regex and extracting the tags to get data points I can use to filter the data~~
- ~~ BIG! Work on CRUD from the backend~~
- ~~ Maybe stagger multiple scripts to scrape more item prices? Might need more ubi accounts to do so. or have the ids file # specified when executing the script with cron schedules ~~
- Once filtering works, button sends request based on status of filter. replaces default landing page content component with the search results component? Would be a cool seemless effect
